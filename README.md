## ⚙️ Configuration Notes

### 🔧 Piston API (Code Execution)

The `views.py` file includes a proxy endpoint for the Piston API to prevent CORS issues from the frontend.

* **Endpoint:** `https://emkc.org/api/v2/piston`
* No API key required for the public tier.

---

### 🎨 Static Files

Tailwind CSS and FontAwesome are currently loaded via CDN in templates.

For production environments, it is recommended to:

* Set up Tailwind using Node.js and PostCSS
* Use Django’s static files pipeline
